## Intersection of Subjects Studied This Semester


### Intersection of Subjects Studied This Semester

This semester, we studied ASIC, ACMOS, DCMOS, Embedded Systems, and FPGA. These subjects have a lot in common when it comes to designing and working with electronic systems. Here's how they connect:

1. **Design and Synthesis Techniques**

   - **Subjects Involved:** ASIC, FPGA
   - **Intersection:** Both ASIC and FPGA are about turning design ideas into actual working circuits. For ASIC, we use special tools to help with this, while FPGA involves working with programmable chips.

2. **Transistor-Level Circuit Design**

   - **Subjects Involved:** ACMOS, DCMOS, ASIC
   - **Intersection:** In ACMOS, we learn about using tiny switches called MOSFETs to build circuits. DCMOS teaches us about basic gates like NOT and NAND. These basics are really important for making ASICs, which are custom chips.

3. **Communication and Interfacing**

   - **Subjects Involved:** Embedded Systems, FPGA
   - **Intersection:** Both subjects deal with how different parts of a system talk to each other. In Embedded Systems, we use microcontrollers like PSoC 5 to handle communication. In FPGA, we focus on making these communications fast and efficient.

4. **Analog and Mixed-Signal Design**

   - **Subjects Involved:** ACMOS, ASIC
   - **Intersection:** ACMOS covers analog parts like amplifiers, which are used in mixed-signal ASICs. These ASICs combine both digital and analog functions in one chip.

5. **System-Level Integration**

   - **Subjects Involved:** ASIC, FPGA, Embedded Systems
   - **Intersection:** This is about putting all the parts together, whether it's on a custom chip (ASIC), a programmable chip (FPGA), or a microcontroller (Embedded Systems). It shows how important it is to design both hardware and software together.

### Conclusion

The subjects we studied this semester all focus on designing and building efficient electronic systems. They give us a good foundation for solving problems in modern electronics and embedded systems.
